# Sip-Theory
Sip Theory is a concept boba brand website I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focused on immersive storytelling, responsive design, and refined UI interactions. Inspired by my years working in boba cafés, this project blends personal experience with creative and technical problem-solving to create an engaging digital product.
